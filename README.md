The project entitled “Collision Game” can be easily implemented by using OpenGL and it is user friendly graphics package. It provides an interface where a user can perform interaction with ease by only input device as interactive device.
The aim of developing this project was to design a simple program using OpenGL application software by applying the concepts and skills we learnt in the class, and in doing so, to understand the algorithms and the techniques underlying interactive graphics better.
